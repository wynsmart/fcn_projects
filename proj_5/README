<HIGH-LEVEL APPROACH>
HTTP:
1. The dnsserver, httpserver bash scripts are called to initiate the dnsserver.py, httpserver.py
2. the httpserver class is initialized with the origin, port number , max # of connections
3. The socket is initialized and threads are created for new connections
4. This class calls the MyReqHandler to handle the incoming connections and their requests.
5. Handler ensures that only 'GET' requests are accepted 

DNS:
1. The dns server is initialized with the port number and the name of the requested website
2. the server waits for incoming request and constructs packet with a response, which is then send back.
3. The QueryParser class is used to unpack the DNS Request to get the necessary parameters.

<CHALLENGES>
1. dns: '\xC0\x0C' changes after packing, which is used as a pointer to the website name in the packet.
2. dns: which flags to exactly set

<TESTING>
- Tested with other domains to get an invalid response.
