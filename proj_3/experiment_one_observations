Config:
CBR: 1mb
Queue at n2: 10
Bandwith (all links): 2Mb
Latency: 10ms

TCP Vegas ran with much less Queue being used up at the node 2
Comparatively TCP Reno, Newreno, Tahoe constantly usd up almost the entire queue of the node n2. But without any packet drops

#######

Config:
CBR: 2mb
Queue at N1: 10
Bandwith (all links): 2Mb
Latency: 10ms

TCP Vegas:
TCP throughput reduces.
Queue at N1 is filled up mostly by UDP packets.
TCP packet drops after 2.8sec from start
N0 does not receive ACKs during 2.8-2.9 sec and hence no new packets till 3.4sec.
TCP sending resumes at 3.49 sec and both packets get dropped due to queue being full.

------
TCP Reno

Max TCP throughput is 16 packets which is initial packet flow nd increases in power of 2 until packets packets are dropped.

Longer timeout period as compared to other TCP variants
TCP flow Resumes with 1 packet and 
If queue is full, CBR packets are dropped and corresponding TCP packets are allowed. No queueing of TCP packets.
Packet flow gradually increases from 4 packets to 5,6,7 

-----
TCP NewReno
2 packets 
4 packets 
8 through
16 packets through
CBR Drops, TCP drops
restart tcp flow with 1 packet
TCP has to wait till > 3 packets in queue.
if there are 3 packets in queue, 1 is transmitted and 2 are left in queue until next one arrive. Till then CBR flow is constant.


After TCP packet drop, TCP flow is 1 packet for 4 packets getting through. Then increments in powers of 2 (at 2.757sec)


------
TCP Tahoe:
CBR packet drops at 1.5 secs
TCP packet drops at 1.544 sec
TCP throughput decreases put packet drop is zero after 1.544
CBR packet drop increases.
After receiving ACK for 1 packet, 2 packets are send, then 4 and so on. Hence Tahoe increases TCP packet window in powers of 2. and consequent number of CBR packets are dropped.
Maximum TCP packets getting through are 8, rest are dropped.
At 16 packets, all are dropped and the TCP packets sent are reduced by powers of 2. and the procedure above is repeated.
