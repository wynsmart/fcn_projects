Config:
CBR: 2Mb
Bandwidth: 2Mb

TCP Tahoe:
No packet drops.
ACKs are slightly delayed.

TCP Reno:
At 1.771sec, ACK get delayed but no packet drop
TCP flow slows down at that point.

ACKs are delayed for every 6th packet.
Hence after 5 packets there is gap in TCP flow.

Minimum TCP ACKs required in the queue at 2 = 3
If ACK packets < 3 then they aren't sent through. Hence this results in long wait to receive acks. CBR flow continues.
